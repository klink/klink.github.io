This repo contains the source code of my personal website.

It is built using mobile-first responsive layout and vanilla JS. Includes my own implementation of image carousel (see [specification](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/prerequisites/image-carousel.md)). 

Other tools used:

* [Font Awesome](fontawesome.com)
* Google Fonts
* Google Analytics
